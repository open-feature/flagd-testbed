Feature: Targeting rules

  # This test suite contains scenarios to test the json-evaluation of flagd and flag-in-process providers.
  # It's associated with the flags configured in flags/changing-flag.json, flags/zero-flags.json, flags/custom-ops.json and evaluator-refs.json.
  # It should be used in conjunction with the suites supplied by the OpenFeature specification.

  Background:
    Given an option "cache" of type "CacheType" with value "disabled"
    And a stable flagd provider

  # evaluator refs
  Scenario Outline: Evaluator reuse
    Given a String-flag with key "<key>" and a default value "fallback"
    And a context containing a key "email", with type "String" and with value "ballmer@macrosoft.com"
    When the flag was evaluated with details
    Then the resolved details value should be "<value>"
    Examples:
      | key                            | value |
      | some-email-targeted-flag       | hi    |
